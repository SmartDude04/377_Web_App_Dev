# Web App Dev Game Project

## Game Requirements

- Needs to be video game like
    - No casino-style game
- Should be fullscreen
- Use mouse + keyboard controls
- Should be fun:
    - Different worldgen every time
    - Grahpically Interesting
- Should have smooth animations

## Ideas

- Create PT Game (No randomization)
- Maze game
- Infinite side-scroller
- Similar to balloon pop (bit boring)


## Theme

- Space
- Maze
- Underwater


## IDEA

- Space game
- No gravity
- spaceship
- Controls:
    - WASD to move ship
        - Moves to a point then background moves
    - Ship points towards the mouse (slight delay, not perfect tracking)
    - Left click to fire bullet
        - Right click to change weapon (2 weapons total, other is laser)
- Healthbar, weapons, etc. at bottom middle of screen
- Instructions appear on page load
    - "ok" at bottom to dismiss them
- Alien ships move randomly and attack your ship
    - [IMPORTANT] At the start they just face the ship and attack when you move over them
    - Healthbar above them
- Asteroids in the way of the ship
    - Cant go through them
- Health slowly regens OR you have to find healing pods to regen
    - Same idea(s) for ammo / energy
